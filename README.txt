I made two graphs. One compares the unemployment rates and the employment
rates of the different states across the years 1976-2015. The rates are in
%s, not absolute.

The other compares the civilian population with the labor force and the
unemployment rate throughout the years (but without states). It's interesting
to see that while both the population and the labor force increase, the
unemployment rate wavers through the years (note 2008).

Sorry if the workbook/pdf contains multiples.
